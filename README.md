# AI Regenerative Medicine

Various Research on my own Practical Applications that apply AI in Regenerative Medicine toward Pluripotent Stem Cells. I also tie in relevant projects
that I will work on in my courses in SJSU's MS AI as a Grad Student.

## Demo Applications

Projects for Each SJSU MS AI Class (PENDING):

- **CMPE 180A** - Data Structures and Algorithms in C++: ?
    - Learn all the concepts and write the code. Then pick an AI/ML Algorithm for Regenerative Medicine.
- **CMPE 180B** - Database Systems: ?
    - Research the most common Database Systems used in the medical field. If they are on legacy systems that aren't used often with AI/ML, create a project
    where you migrate that data from legacy systems to more common Database Systems used with AI/ML Platforms.
    - Ex: Where does the data come from that gets imported into H2O.ai's Driverless AI Platform or H2O.ai's H2O-3 Open Source AI Platform?
- **CMPE 252** - Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering: ?
- **CMPE 255** - Data Mining: ?
- **CMPE 257** - Machine Learning: ?
- **CMPE 258** - Deep Learning: ?
- **ISE 244** - AI Tools and Practice for Systems Engineering: ?
    - Think about Biomedical Engineer/Bioengineer as System Engineer that needs the AI Tools. What kind of AI Tools?
- **CMPE 249** - Intelligent Autonomous Systems
    - Ex: Neuralink uses an intelligent surgical robot that is able to implant Embedded AI Chip into Human Skull. Neuralink's Goal is to merge AI with Humans.
- **CMPE 256** - Web and Big Data Mining: ?
    - Ex: Think about Healthcare databases, what insights can we mine for the AI Algorithms to create ML Models related to Regenerative Medicine issues.
- **ENGR200W** or **CMPE294** - Engineering Reports and Graduate Research: ?
    - Waive course by creating a solo publication published in IEEE. I could do research with a professor on AI and Regenerative Medicine and publish a paper, 
    then report to SJSU to get this course waived.
- **Master Thesis** or **Master Project**? - Effort toward AI and Regenerative Medicine


## Research Articles

- [Artificial intelligence: A joint narrative on potential use in pediatric stem and immune cell therapies and regenerative medicine](https://www-sciencedirect-com.libaccess.sjlibrary.org/science/article/pii/S1473050218301721)
    - **Purpose**: The goal of this article is to review the use of AI method for cellular therapy and regenerative medicine and emphasize its potential to further the progress in these fields of medicine
    - **Goal of AI**: The central goals of AI research are reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, natural language processing (communication), perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.
    - **Paper Emphasis**: Emphasis is placed on recognition and application of AI techniques in the development of predictive models for personalized treatments with engineered stem cells, immune cells and regenerated tissues in adults and children.
